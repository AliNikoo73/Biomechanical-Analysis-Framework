## üìä Simulation Results

Our framework produces detailed biomechanical analyses, including:

### Joint Angle Analysis

<img src="./simulation_results/joint_angles.png" alt="Joint Angles" width="700">

**Description:** This plot shows the joint angles (in degrees) for the hip, knee, and ankle throughout a complete gait cycle (0-100%). Key features include:
- **Hip Flexion/Extension (red):** Shows hip joint movement, with positive values indicating flexion and negative values indicating extension
- **Knee Flexion/Extension (green):** Shows the characteristic knee flexion pattern during stance and swing phases
- **Ankle Dorsi/Plantarflexion (blue):** Shows ankle movement, with upward deflection indicating dorsiflexion and downward indicating plantarflexion
- **Vertical dashed line:** Marks the transition from stance to swing phase (toe-off) at approximately 60% of the gait cycle

### Ground Reaction Forces

<img src="./simulation_results/ground_reaction_forces.png" alt="Ground Reaction Forces" width="700">

**Description:** This plot displays the ground reaction forces (as % of body weight) throughout the gait cycle:
- **Vertical GRF (red):** Shows the characteristic double-peak pattern of vertical force during stance phase, with the first peak representing weight acceptance and the second peak representing push-off
- **Anterior-Posterior GRF (green):** Shows braking forces (negative values) in early stance and propulsive forces (positive values) in late stance
- **Medial-Lateral GRF (blue):** Shows the smaller medial-lateral forces during walking
- **Forces reduce to zero** during swing phase (after 60%) when the foot is no longer in contact with the ground

### Muscle Activation Patterns

<img src="./simulation_results/emg_activity.png" alt="EMG Activity" width="700">

**Description:** This plot shows the electromyography (EMG) activity patterns of key lower limb muscles during the gait cycle:
- **Gastrocnemius:** Primarily active during mid to late stance phase, with peak activity during push-off
- **Tibialis Anterior:** Shows two main activity periods - during initial contact to control foot placement and during swing phase for ankle dorsiflexion
- **Quadriceps:** Most active during early stance phase for weight acceptance and knee stability
- **Hamstrings:** Active during late swing and early stance phases to decelerate the limb and control knee extension

### Comprehensive Gait Analysis

<img src="./simulation_results/combined_gait_analysis.png" alt="Combined Gait Analysis" width="700">

**Description:** This comprehensive visualization integrates all key biomechanical parameters to provide a complete view of the gait cycle:
- **Top panel:** Joint angles showing coordinated movement patterns of hip, knee, and ankle
- **Middle panel:** Ground reaction forces showing the interaction between the foot and ground
- **Bottom panels:** Muscle activation patterns divided into lower leg muscles (left) and upper leg muscles (right)

This integrated view allows researchers to examine the relationships between joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity throughout the gait cycle.
