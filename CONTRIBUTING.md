# Contributing to Biomechanics Analysis Framework

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Write docstrings in Google format
- Use type hints where possible

## Testing

- Write unit tests using pytest
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run tests locally before submitting PR:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update API documentation using Sphinx
- Add or update examples if needed
- Include docstrings for all public functions

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the requirements.txt if you add dependencies
3. Update the version numbers following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two maintainers

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/biomech-analysis-framework/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/biomech-analysis-framework/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
