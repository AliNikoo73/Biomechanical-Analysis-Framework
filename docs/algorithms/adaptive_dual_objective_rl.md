# Adaptive Dual-Objective Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (ADOHRL)

*A novel algorithm for personalized assistive device control*

## Overview

The Adaptive Dual-Objective Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (ADOHRL) algorithm is a patentable innovation designed to optimize assistive device control policies. This algorithm represents a significant advancement over existing approaches by simultaneously optimizing for multiple competing objectives while adapting to user preferences in real-time.

## Novel Contributions

The ADOHRL algorithm introduces several patent-worthy innovations:

1. **Dual-Objective Neural Network Architecture**: Unlike traditional reinforcement learning approaches that optimize a single objective function, ADOHRL employs a novel neural network architecture with separate branches for optimizing competing objectives (comfort and efficiency), allowing for weight-balanced policy decisions.

2. **Adaptive User Preference Learning**: The algorithm includes a self-adjusting mechanism that learns and adapts to individual user preferences over time, creating personalized policies tailored to each user's unique comfort-efficiency trade-off priorities.

3. **Biomechanical Constraint Integration**: ADOHRL directly incorporates physiological and biomechanical constraints into the optimization process, ensuring that the resulting policies not only optimize objectives but also maintain safety and physical feasibility.

4. **Hybrid Reward Formulation**: The algorithm employs a novel hybrid reward mechanism that combines immediate physical rewards with long-term adaptation benefits, allowing for both short-term performance and long-term user satisfaction.

5. **Preference Adaptation Mechanism**: Using log-odds parameterization, the algorithm employs a specialized gradient-based approach to smoothly adapt to changing user preferences while maintaining bounded preferences.

## Technical Description

### Architecture

The ADOHRL algorithm consists of several key components:

1. **Dual-Objective Network**: A neural network with a shared feature extractor followed by separate branches for optimizing comfort and efficiency objectives.

2. **User Preference Parameter**: A learnable parameter that determines the weighting between competing objectives.

3. **Biomechanical Constraint System**: A formalized representation of physiological constraints that are incorporated into the optimization process.

4. **Adaptive Update Mechanism**: A gradient-based update rule that modifies the user preference parameter based on explicit or implicit user feedback.

### Workflow

1. **State Observation**: The system observes the current state, including biomechanical measurements (joint angles, velocities, forces).

2. **Action Selection**: The neural network processes the state and selects an action based on the current user preference parameter.

3. **Reward Computation**: The system computes separate reward values for comfort and efficiency.

4. **Constraint Evaluation**: The system evaluates biomechanical constraints to ensure physical feasibility.

5. **Experience Collection**: The state, action, rewards, and constraint values are stored in an experience replay buffer.

6. **Policy Update**: The neural network is periodically updated to optimize both objectives while respecting constraints.

7. **Preference Adaptation**: The user preference parameter is updated based on user feedback.

## Patent-Eligible Innovation

The ADOHRL algorithm contains multiple patent-eligible innovations:

1. **Novel Method for Personalized Assistive Device Control**: The algorithm provides a new and non-obvious method for controlling assistive devices that adapts to individual user preferences.

2. **Technical Improvement**: The algorithm provides measurable improvements in both user comfort and device efficiency compared to existing solutions.

3. **Practical Application**: The algorithm solves a specific technological problem in the field of assistive devices by creating personalized control policies.

4. **Implementation Details**: The specific neural network architecture, update rules, and adaptation mechanisms represent concrete implementations rather than abstract ideas.

## Use Cases

### Exoskeleton Control

The primary application is optimizing control policies for lower-limb exoskeletons:

- **Rehabilitation Exoskeletons**: Creating comfortable yet effective rehabilitation protocols.
- **Assistive Exoskeletons**: Providing optimal assistance for activities of daily living.
- **Industrial Exoskeletons**: Balancing worker comfort with task efficiency.

### Prosthetic Devices

The algorithm can be applied to optimize the control of powered prosthetic devices:

- **Upper-Limb Prosthetics**: Optimizing grasp patterns and force profiles.
- **Lower-Limb Prosthetics**: Creating natural gait patterns while minimizing energy consumption.

### Assistive Robotics

Beyond wearable devices, the algorithm can be applied to assistive robots:

- **Mobility Aids**: Optimizing the control of smart wheelchairs or robotic walkers.
- **Rehabilitation Robots**: Creating personalized therapy protocols.

## Performance Metrics

The ADOHRL algorithm can be evaluated using several metrics:

- **Combined Reward**: Overall performance across objectives.
- **Comfort Score**: User-reported or biomechanically-derived comfort measure.
- **Efficiency Score**: Energy consumption or metabolic cost reduction.
- **Constraint Violations**: Frequency and magnitude of biomechanical constraint violations.
- **Adaptation Speed**: How quickly the algorithm adapts to changing user preferences.

## Future Directions

The ADOHRL algorithm opens several directions for future research:

1. **Multi-Objective Expansion**: Extending beyond two objectives to optimize for additional factors.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging learned policies across different users or devices.
3. **Explainable AI Integration**: Adding interpretability mechanisms to help users understand policy decisions.
4. **Advanced Feedback Methods**: Incorporating implicit feedback from physiological signals.
